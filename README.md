## 🎯 What is this?

This is just a **practice repo** where I’m trying to teach my code how to behave like a student —  
It can enroll, attend classes (aka `methods`), and sometimes... crash during exams (aka `exceptions`) 😵‍💫.

---

## 💡 Why does this exist?

Because:
- I need to practice Java 💻
- I like pressing `Ctrl + S` for no reason 😅
- And mostly because Stack Overflow said so 👨‍🏫

---

## 📦 What's inside?

- `Student.java` — The good kid
- `Main.java` — The principal running the show
- Maybe more chaos to come...

---

## 🧪 Will it run?

Yes.  
Will it run correctly?  
Uhh... that depends on your karma and Java version 😎

## 🔥 Live Demo

## 🙅‍♂️ Don't Copy. Just LOL.

Please **don't copy-paste** this code for any real projects — your code will start skipping classes.  
Instead, use it to:
- Learn something
- Laugh at your own errors
- And make your own version better 🚀

## 👋 Final Words

Stay curious. Keep coding. And don’t forget to semicolon your life properly. `;`
