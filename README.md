# 🧪 Practiced Codes — Because Greatness Starts With Ugly Code 😅

> Welcome to my **playground of bugs, fixes, and “oops that worked?” moments** 🤯
 
> ⚠️ Warning: This repo contains dangerously basic Java and Python codes.  
> If you're looking for production-ready magic... you're lost, my friend. 🚪🚶


## 💡 Why does this exist?
Because:
- I need to practice Java 💻
- I like pressing `Ctrl + S` for no reason 😅
- And mostly because Stack Overflow said so 👨‍🏫

Here, you’ll find:
- 🚧 Half-baked logic
- 🧃 Overused loops
- 🫣 Classes trying to be useful
- And of course... plenty of semicolons doing their best `;`
- Maybe more chaos to come...


## 🧪 Will it run?
Yes.  
Will it run correctly?  
Uhh... that depends on your karma and Java version 😎

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
> 📢 **Don’t copy this code blindly!**  
> It’s here so I can laugh at it later, and maybe learn something in the process.  
> You can peek, get inspired, or roast it 🔥

## 😂 Fun Fact
Every time I fix one bug...  
Two new ones spawn.  
Coincidence?  
**No. It’s Java.** 

## 🔥 Live Demo
Oh, you want a live demo?

## 🙅‍♂️ Don't Copy. Just LOL.
Please **don't copy-paste** this code for any real projects — your code will start skipping classes.  
Instead, use it to:
- Learn something
- Laugh at your own errors
- And make your own version better 🚀

## 👋 Final Words
Stay curious. Keep coding. And don’t forget to semicolon your life properly. `;`

Let me know if you want a dark mode version, or one personalized with your photo/meme/quote — I can remix this into any flavor you want 😄
